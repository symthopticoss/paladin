**Important**
Paladin was originally created in early 2024 by a team of developers. Paladin was never used or nor released on github. We released it in 2025 for **nothing**. Palaidn used Hexactyl Z11 which is supported by Helium, although Z11 is outdated and replaced with UI10 a more **powerful UI** which powers our rest of client areas
